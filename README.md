Programable arduino Aquarium controler for RGB-led strips

I made this for use with my tropical aquarium to drive multible led strips with shiftregisters (3x 74HC595 )
So I can drive 3x8 = 24 (led) channels on my aquarium!

You can find smart things in this sketch like:

* Controle the settings by IR remote
* use of ShiftPWM libary to easy set the shiftregisters (by Eelco Jacobs: http://www.elcojacobs.com)
* Programing the time table to make a sunrise and sunset with color and intensity shifts.
* Optional Moonphase function
* Realtime Clock setup
* Shiftbalancing for the reqisters
